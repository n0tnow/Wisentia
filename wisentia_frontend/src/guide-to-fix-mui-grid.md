# Guide to Fix MUI Grid Warnings

This guide addresses the following MUI Grid warnings:
- "The `item` prop has been removed and is no longer necessary"
- "The `xs`, `md`, `sm` props have been removed"

## Upgrading to Grid v2

MUI has released Grid v2 which changes how grid layout works. Here's how to update your components:

### Step 1: Install the new grid package

```bash
npm install @mui/system
```

### Step 2: Update imports

Change your imports from:
```jsx
import { Grid } from '@mui/material';
```

To:
```jsx
import Grid from '@mui/material/Unstable_Grid2';
```

### Step 3: Update Grid props

The new Grid API has changed. Here's how to convert your old Grid code to the new format:

#### Old code:
```jsx
<Grid container spacing={3}>
  <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={4}>
    <Content />
  </Grid>
</Grid>
```

#### New code:
```jsx
<Grid container spacing={3}>
  <Grid xs={12} sm={6} md={4}>
    <Content />
  </Grid>
</Grid>
```

Note the changes:
- Remove the `item` prop (it's no longer needed)
- Keep the dimension props (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, etc.)

### Example Files to Update

Based on the warnings, the following files need to be updated:
1. `/src/app/admin/users/page.jsx`
2. `/src/app/courses/[courseId]/page.jsx`
3. `/src/app/settings/page.jsx`
4. `/src/app/quests/page.jsx`
5. `/src/app/admin/generate-quest/page.jsx`
6. `/src/app/admin/generate-quiz/page.jsx`
7. `/src/app/nfts/page.jsx`

### Approach

For each file:
1. Update the Grid import to use the new version
2. Remove the `item` prop from all Grid components
3. Keep all sizing props (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, etc.)
4. Test the layout to make sure everything looks correct
